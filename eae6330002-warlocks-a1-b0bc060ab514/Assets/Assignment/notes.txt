F for Gravity Well, B for Meteor, T for Stealth, V for Spell Shield.

What workflow enhancement did you implement in the editor?
[Insert your answer here]

Any other comments?
[I've created a robust Damage system and also a good system for Unit Statistics that ties into the Items.
I've added to the UnitStatus system to handle Stun, Knockback & Spell Immunity.
Although, these systems do still need some more work to be completed.]
