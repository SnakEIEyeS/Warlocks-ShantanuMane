What are the controls for the locally controlled unit?
[Right-click to move. Left-click to select a unit.
Q to cast Push, W to cast Teleport, E to cast Fireball, D to cast Blast, 
F for Gravity Well, B for Meteor, T for Stealth, V for Spell Shield.
S to stop any action.]

What workflow enhancement did you implement in the editor?
[Insert your answer here]

Any other comments?
[I've made the base framework for AI. I've also made the framework for an Aggressive AI 
that makes use of the Utility Theory. It has bugs though, and the assignment is incomplete.
Although, the base framework can be tested using the TestMove and TestCast functions in the AggressiveAI,
which have been commented in the Start function.]
