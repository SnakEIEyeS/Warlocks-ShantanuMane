Assignment Notes

Assignment: [7 - Multiplayer]
Student: [Shantanu Mane]

What are the controls for the locally controlled unit?
[Right-click to move. Left-click to select a unit.
Q to cast Push, W to cast Teleport, E to cast Fireball, D to cast Blast, 
F for Gravity Well, B for Meteor, T for Stealth, V for Spell Shield.
S to stop any action.]

What workflow enhancement did you implement in the editor?
[]

Any other comments?
[I have done spawning, movement, ability casting, health, damage, status effects over the network.
I have also done the game loop, but due to some incorrect reference handling that I could not figure out,
there is a bug where only the Master's UI is properly handled. A weird bug with spawning happening too many times
might also occur.
I have updated all the abilities to work over the network, except Gravity Well which I couldn't properly do. It works in a crazy way on the Master at least.
Teleport works fine for the Master, but for Clients it teleports them to the edges of the map. 
They can walk back across the map, so it shouldn't affect testing.
I've setup most of the game to work on the Master - 
Abilities do their actual processing on the Master, but listen to events on the Client.
Client Units are handled on the Client itself. 
All Damage and Status Effects are handled primarily on the Master and then relayed to the Client.
I have disabled Camera Controls because it is very inconvenient to test multiple game windows with them On.]
